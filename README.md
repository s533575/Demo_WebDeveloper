Hello Professor

I have attached a zip file nd i request you to unzip it and try to run the index.html file.

I have created two navigation tab bar.
One lands on the home page which consists of professor details and the second nav bar is resarch.
The research page tells all the research that has been done based on the selection values.

I have tried doing the dropdown with the country list and as well as food type. 
Based on our selection it displays below the dropdown showing the selected details that we have selected from the dropdown. 
In the real time we will connect the same with database with respect to the selected values and will display them below. 
since don't have any database i tried printing the values that we are selecting. Multiple selection is working.
Try to click on ctrl and drag down. As well as we can easily get the values from database once we have a setup through ajax call. 
i have written a sample code for ajax call and i havent called that function, so that doesn't create a problem. 
Even I have blocked the second dropdowna and it will enable only when we select the fisrt drop down.

Thank you for giving me this oppurtunity.
